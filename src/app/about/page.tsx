                Though being one of the major players in this project, the truth
                remains that&#44; without the help of some significant people,
                this project wouldn&apos;t have been possible. But then
                again&#44; he still contributed even if it wasn&apos;t fully.
                One thing that can be said about him that he&apos;s really
                creative. He has come up with a lot of different ways to resolve
                a problem in programming. Whenever he&apos; stuck on something
                and doesn&apos;t know how to get around it&#44; instead of
                giving up&#44; he finds his own way to do it based on what he
                has seen. So to summarize all this&#44; he&apos;s a really good
                programmer who as an open mind and is willing to learn anything.
